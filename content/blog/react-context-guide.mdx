React Context eliminates prop drilling. But what exactly is prop drilling, and how does Context help?

**Prop drilling** is when you pass data through multiple component layers just to reach a deeply nested component. Context provides a direct channel for data flow, bypassing intermediate components.

### What is React Context?

React Context creates a direct channel for data flow, *bypassing intermediate components entirely*.

### How to Use React Context

Using React Context involves **three** main steps:

### 1. Creating the Context

First, we create a Context object:

```typescript
import React from "react";
const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");
```

### 2. Providing the Context

Next, we wrap our component tree with a Context Provider:

```typescript
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Consuming the Context

Finally, we can use the Context in any nested component:

```typescript
function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button className={`btn-${theme}`}>I'm styled by theme context!</button>
  );
}
```

### A Practical Example

Here's a complete theme toggle implementation:

```typescript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

// Create the context
const ThemeContext = createContext({
  theme: "light",
  toggleTheme: () => {},
});

// Provider component
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(prev => prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
  };
  
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Consumer component
function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Current theme: {theme}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Best Practices

When using React Context, consider:

- Using Context for truly global or deeply nested data
- Splitting unrelated data into separate contexts
- Performance implications for frequently changing data

The React DevTools extension can help you inspect your Context providers and consumers.

### Conclusion

React Context is a powerful tool for managing state across your application. When used in the right context (pun absolutely intended), it can help make your code more organized and easier to maintain.
